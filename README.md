Insights Gained from the Analysis

Key Trends: 1.New Orleans Pelicans have the most employees, while Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic have the fewest. 2.The most common positions are Shooting Guard (SG) and Power Forward (PF), while Center (C) has the fewest employees. 3.Most employees are in the 20-30 age group, with very few over 30.

Key Patterns & Correlations:

Most employees are under 30, while older age groups are almost absent. The Los Angeles Lakers and Small Forward (SF) position have the highest salary expenditure. A positive correlation (0.21) exists between age and salary, meaning older employees tend to earn more, but the link is weak.

Key Insights:

The company focuses on hiring younger talent, as seen in the large number of employees under 30. High salaries are concentrated in key teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and in positions like Small Forward (SF). Although older employees tend to have higher salaries, age alone does not strongly influence salary.
